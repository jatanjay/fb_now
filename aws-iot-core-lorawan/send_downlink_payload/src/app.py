        PayloadData : str,  Base64 encoded twice
            Please note this this function expects that a binary payload is encoded twice using Base64.

            To understand the reason for double encoding, let's consider how a binary payload 
            (e.g. 0x414243) is processed in this sample:

            1. You initiate sending of data to a LoRaWAN devices by invocation of the AWS IoT Rule
               SendDataToWirelessDeviceRule. The rule can be invoked either by due to subscription
               as define in WHERE clause (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-sql-from.html) or via Basic Ingest (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-basic-ingest.html).

               For example you can invoke SendDataToWirelessDeviceRule by publishing to the MQTT broker topic `cmd/downlink/c7867453-5404-4680-a081-0fda2902110a`. You could also perform Basic Ingest by publishing to $aws/rules/SendDataToWirelessDeviceRule/cmd/downlink/c7867453-5404-4680-a081-0fda2902110a .

            2. The AWS IoT Rule SendDataToWirelessDeviceRule expects Base64-encoded payload as an input.

            3. Before AWS IoT Rule SendDataToWirelessDeviceRule can pass a payload to this AWS Lambda function, the payload have to be Base64-encoded once again. Please consult 
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/binary-payloads.html for details.

        TransmitMode : int
            Please consult AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN documentation for details.
